# SolveX3's solutions for the 2025 Advent of Code event

You know Advent of Code, right? That annual event hosted by Eric Wastl at adventofcode.com where people write code to solve puzzles during the month of December? I figured 
it'd be fun to try it out this year to derust my C++ skills. And I also figured it'd be a good idea to put my solutions up on GitHub to build a portfolio in case any 
potential employers want to see something like that :3

Should be pretty clear how I have this organized; there's 12 numbered folders for each day, with titles added to describe the puzzles. Each folder contains the C++ code 
for both of my solutions, as well as any extra files I used for input.

If you are viewing this repository during the 2025 Advent of Code event and you have *not* completed the puzzles yourself yet, I highly encourage you Not to cheat and to 
try and solve them on your own before looking at my solutions; it's more fun that way :3 And if you have solved them already and you wanna compare your solutions to mine 
for whatever reason, feel free ^w^
